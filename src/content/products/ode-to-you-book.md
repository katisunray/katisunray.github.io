An Ode to You, Our Baby

A poetic book for babies, toddlers, and new parents that cherishes every child and celebrates the joy of simple moments that babies enable us to live and witness when we are mindful of the present moment. It reminds us to be present, seize every second together, and embrace the most important thing in the world - LOVE.

A must-have for the nursery shelf!

Kati Sunray is an author and mother of three. Inspired by real-life moments with her children and family, she wrote this book to capture their cherished experiences. She also painted the illustrations as a heartfelt tribute to these simple, yet special moments shared together.
